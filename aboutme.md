Hello!
My name is Kevin. I'm an early-career data professional with a focus towards modern data management techniques and technologies. I am a Microsoft Certified Data Engineer Associate as well as a Databricks Data Engineer Associate.

In my first tech role at Cognizant, I learned a lot about cloud services and how to run analytics pipelines using Azure Synapse Analytics.

In 2021, I graduated Lambda School's Data Science program, where I gained experience working on cross-functional teams, building predictive models, and analyzing data. My background in both pure and applied mathematics guides my focused and detailed approach to solving problems.

## Contact Me

I am currently seeking roles related to data science and engineering, as well as backend software development.
