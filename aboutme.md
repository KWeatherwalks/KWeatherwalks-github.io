Hello!
My name is Kevin, and I'm a data scientist.

I'm a recent graduate of Lambda School's Data Science program, where I gained experience working on cross-functional teams, building predictive models, and analyzing data. My background in both pure and applied mathematics guides my focused and detailed approach to solving problems. I have a passion for understanding statistics, predictions, and systems. I consider myself a lifelong student as I am constantly learning more about everything from [Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) to [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).

My experience with Python, Java, Matlab, and R facilitates learning new languages, packages, and frameworks.

## Contact Me

I am currently seeking roles related to data science and engineering, as well as backend development.
Reach out to me at kevin.weatherwalks@gmail.com to talk more about how I can help your team.
