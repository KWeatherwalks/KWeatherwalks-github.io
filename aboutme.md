Hello!
My name is Kevin, and I'm a data scientist.

I'm a recent graduate of Lambda School's Data Science program, where I gained experience working on cross-functional teams, building predictive models, and analyzing data. My background in both pure and applied mathematics guides my focused and detailed approach to solving problems. I have a passion for understanding statistics, predictions, and systems. I consider myself a lifelong student as I am constantly learning more about everything from [Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) to [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).

My experience with Python, Java, Matlab, and R facilitates learning new languages, packages, and frameworks.

I am currently seeking roles related to data science and engineering, as well as backend development.
Reach out to me at kevin.weatherwalks@gmail.com to talk more about how I can help your team.

#### Things I enjoy

I'm an avid user of both Todoist and Notion to organize my work.  
I spend 15 minutes every morning learning German and French on Duolingo.  
I enjoy walking and hiking with my fiancee around the parks in Newark while catching Pokemon in Pokemon Go.  
I like to use [Elevate](https://elevateapp.com/) every day to improve my reading, writing, and editing skills.
I love to cook. It's an activity that blends scientific thinking and artistic creation in a delightful way.  
I like watching Jeopardy! and SNL, filling in crossword puzzles during the commercial breaks.
