Hello!
My name is Kevin, and I'm a data scientist.

I'm a recent graduate of Lambda School's Data Science program, where I gained experience working on cross-functional teams, building predictive models, and analyzing data. My background in both pure and applied mathematics guides my focused and detailed approach to solving problems. I have a passion for understanding statistics, predictions, and systems. I consider myself a lifelong student as I am constantly learning more about everything from [Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) to [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).

My experience with Python, Java, Matlab, and R facilitates learning new languages, packages, and frameworks.

I am currently seeking roles related to data science and engineering, as well as backend development.
Reach out to me at kevin.weatherwalks@gmail.com to talk more about how I can help your team.

#### Things I enjoy

- Organizing my work with Todoist and Notion so I can GTD.  
- Learning German, French, Spanish, and Korean on Duolingo by practicing for 15 minutes every day.  
- Walking and hiking with my fiancée around the parks in Newark while catching Pokémon in Pokémon Go.  
- Improving my writing, editing, and reading skills with [Elevate](https://elevateapp.com/).
- Cooking — it's an activity that blends scientific thinking and artistic creation in a delightful way.  
- Watching *Jeopardy!* and *SNL*, filling in crossword puzzles during the commercial breaks.
