## Data Science Quiz

I'm creating a quiz app for data science learners. I plan to create a FastAPI application using a Docker container so the application can be uploaded to a cloud service to be chosen later.

### Product Vision

- Multiple choice questions (at first, to make validation easy)
- Each question will have 4-5 options
- Images may be used for options

### Help me generate and source content

This application will be open source and free, with a promise to not be used for commercial purposes. Therefore, the sources used must be open source and able to be redistributed.
We can create original content—a lot of work—or we can potentially use sources like Khan Academy as inspiration.
