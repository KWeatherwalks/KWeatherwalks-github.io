# Introduction
For the final unit of my Lambda School journey, I worked on a large team of 20+ developers and data scientists for the nonprofit Human Rights First (HRF). HRF helps connect immigration attorneys with asylum seekers and provides valuable resources for those attorneys. One such resource is a web-based application that will allow users to view information about an immigration judge's past decisions and any factors that appear to bias those decisions.
We were under tight time pressure because Lambda breaks units into blocks of four weeks.

# Planning
Met with web team to discuss architecture for visualization flow.  
Daniel created architecture diagrams that were clear and explained them very well.
Worked with Plotly to set up the data flow.

# How you went about problem-solving?
- Met with Filipe and web team to set up work flow for the visualizations. 
- Week two, we explored individual data viz and set up deployment of DS API
- Week two,
