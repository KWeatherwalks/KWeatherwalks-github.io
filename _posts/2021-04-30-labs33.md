# Introduction
For the final unit of my Lambda School journey, I worked on a large team of 20+ developers and data scientists for the nonprofit Human Rights First (HRF). HRF helps connect immigration attorneys with asylum seekers and provides valuable resources for those attorneys. One such resource is a web-based application that will allow users to view information about an immigration judge's past decisions and any factors that appear to bias those decisions.
We were under tight time pressure because Lambda breaks units into blocks of four weeks.
