# Introduction
For the final unit of my Lambda School journey, I worked on a large team of 20+ developers and data scientists for the nonprofit Human Rights First (HRF). HRF helps connect immigration attorneys with asylum seekers and provides valuable resources for those attorneys. One such resource is a web-based application that will allow users to view information about an immigration judge's past decisions and any factors that appear to bias those decisions.  

## The problem(s)
- We want feedback from the stakeholder and users. We need a workflow for researching visualization ideas and seamlessly integrating them into the web application.
- We need to coordinate on the styling of the visualizations, and the web team has ownership over those choices.

# Planning

- Met with web team to discuss architecture for visualization flow.  
- Daniel created architecture diagrams that were clear and explained them very well.
- Worked with Plotly to set up the data flow. (link to Plotly docs)


# How you went about problem-solving?
- Met with Filipe and web team to set up work flow for the visualizations. 
- Week two, we explored individual data viz and set up deployment of DS API
- Week two,

# The problem solving
- Data type issues arose. Needed to fix the workflow.
