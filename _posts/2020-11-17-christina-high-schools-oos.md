## Foreword
There are two definitions of race that are important to note so that we treat interpretations of the data used in this article with care. One describes it as the perceived differences in groups of people based on physical and genetic traits. 
In this sense, race *does not exist* as the differences within any group of people are wider and more numerous than differences between groups.[cite] In her book *Superior: The Return of Race Science*, Angela Saini covers the long history of such horrific and failed attempts to categorize people based on physical and genetic traits along with the atrocities generated by and associated with those attempts. I stand with Saini in saying that this type of research is beyond unethical and should not be conducted. 

A second definition involves the common groups of people that arise as a result of this sorting. As such, studies involving race which are useful center around the sociological effects of using these labels as identities by examining how the systems we create—and the policies we enact—negatively impact people ascribed to or identifying with these labels. I strongly feel that we need to be able to identify the systems that permit racial inequities to persist so we can enact antiracist policies.[Kendi]

## Introduction
It is well documented that there is racial inequity in student discipline so this analysis won't reveal anything that we don't already know.[cite] 

See the [notebook](https://github.com/KWeatherwalks/DSPortfolio/blob/main/Christina_high_schools_discipline.ipynb) on Github for more details.

### Research Question
Like any research project, my questions were very broad at the beginning and soon narrowed to something that was answerable with the data provided.  
__Broad:__ Is there racial inequity in student disciplinary approaches?  
__Specific:__ In the 2018-2019 school year, did public high schools in the Christina School District assign out-of-school suspensions to 9th graders in equal proportions to their race category?  

#### Method
The preferred method to answer this type of question is a $\chi^2$ test for independence between the race category and whether a student was given an out-of-school suspension or not. This method assumes that number of out-of-school suspensions divided by the number of enrolled students in any particular category is the same for every category . That is, all students have an equal chance of receiving at least one out-of-school suspension.

#### Null and Alternate Hypotheses
To conduct the $chi^2$ test, first define the null hypothesis as there being no relation between racial category and out-of-school suspensions. The alternate hypothesis naturally being that there is such a relation.  
Set the significance at the standard $\alpha=0.05$ and correct for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni.[cite] With 3 comparisons, an adjusted significance level $\alpha^\prime$ for each test is about $0.016$.

## Data Wrangling
### Socrata Open Data
The dataset we will be using is from the data.delaware.gov open data portal which we will access via Socrata's API endpoints.\[[1]\]  
<img src="/assets/blogresources/student_discipline_api.png" width="525">  
Through this endpoint, the data comes to us in JSON format and by default is limited to 1000 rows. We can get all the 653,417 rows of the data by appending the url with `$limit=654000` \[[2]\]


### Set up Contingency Tables
The rows of the dataset contain aggregated counts of disciplinary action by subgroup, a derivative of the race, gender and special demo categories. In order to create a two-way (contingency) table with the race category as the index and out-of-school suspension vs. no out-of-school suspension as the columns, we need to filter the dataset. 
[insert picture of dataset snippet]
There is no column for counts of no out-of-school suspension, so we have to create that column using some feature engineering.

## Conclusion
For all three schools, we reject the null hypothesis at the .017 significance level and conclude that there is a relationship between racial category and receiving out-of-school suspension.  
Let me be clear about the conclusions that can be drawn from conducting this analysis. The analysis presented here cannot explain *why* there are differences in disciplinary action due to racial identity. It can only illuminate the reality that such differences exist. 

## Afterword
I know what you're probably thinking. Why is this white cisgender man doing an analysis involving race? I have asked myself this same question over the past couple weeks as I worked on this project. My discomfort, and possibly yours, is why I feel obligated to state my beliefs outright in saying black lives matter. Full stop. What I have learned about our country's history and policies in the past few years has upset me as much as it has galvanized. I hope you feel the same.
