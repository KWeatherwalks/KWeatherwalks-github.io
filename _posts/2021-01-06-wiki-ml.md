# Introduction
Since its inception, the free encyclopedia has had its share of critics, particularly in institutions of higher education.
My personal experience with Wikipedia has been generally positive. When exploring calculus ideas during my Khan Academy self-study, I found the site to be great for exploring the history behind the development of mathematical fields of study. Wiki articles—which discussed both famous science people and used language (mathematics) that was so foreign to me—were such a strong motivator that I decided to finally enroll in college to pursue a STEM degree so that I could learn how to think like a mathematician.

While my math professors seemed not to have a strong opinion, professors in other disciplines were reluctant to endorse the website as a learning tool. "Wikipedia is not a source" was a common refrain, implying that we should never cite a Wiki page in our academic work. However, some of the educators I encountered held a more nuanced view. "Wikipedia is a tertiary source. It's fine for a general overview, but you need to follow the sources cited on the page to use in your research projects." These kinds of differences in opinion have inspired research into identifying the factors that contribute to the adoption of Wikipedia as a teaching aid.

A 2016 paper titled [*Factors that influence the teaching use of Wikipedia in higher education*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1002/asi.23488) surveyed  faculty members at two universities in Spain in an effort to understand how Wikipedia has been adopted in teaching and which criteria make an educator likely to use Wikipedia in their classes. The team shared [the dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wiki4he) with the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. Where that research used a Technology Acceptance Model to identify connections between survey question types, this article seeks to explore a few fundamental machine learning models, such as *logistic regression* and *random forest classifiers,* to predict how Wikipedia will be used.

## Survey Data
A common technique in data gathering via survey is to frame questions as statements to be self assessed on a scale from 1 to 5 with the low and high ends corresponding to *strong disagreement* and *strong agreement,* respectively. The middle value in the scale is typically interpreted as having a *neutral* stance on the question at hand. This is known as a Likert scale, named after psychologist [Rensis Likert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale).  

This type of ordinal data brings about many decisions for data scientists to make when constructing predictive models. It isn't quantitative, it's not merely categorical, but the differences between adjacent values are subjective and not necessarily uniform across features. If treated as quantitative, a regression model would be a good candidate to try. If treated as categorical, then ensemble tree methods like random forest might yield a useful model. Which one is better for this data? Let's compare them.


## Target: Use Behavior
There are five use behaviors that may serve as a target for a predictive binary classification model:  
- USE1: I use Wikipedia to develop my teaching materials
- USE2: I use Wikipedia as a platform to develop educational activities with students
- USE3: I recommend my students to use Wikipedia
- USE4: I recommend my colleagues to use Wikipedia
- USE5: I agree my students use Wikipedia in my courses

You can try a model for each one of these using the notebooks in [the repo](https://github.com/KWeatherwalks/EduWikiML). This post will focus on USE2.

## Features used
The features include demographic data (Age, gender, job position, ...) in addition to self-assessed survey responses (Likert scale). We'll use all of the dataset variables not classified as Use Behavior to build a model.


## Data processing
Though the dataset is relatively clean and tidy, it does contain missing values which have to be dealt with.

For the target variable, the USE2 values are grouped and remapped so that 4 and 5 correspond to a 'Yes' response while 1 and 2 correspond to a 'No' response. Entries where USE2 is 3 are dropped from the training set. This gives us binary outcomes which permit simpler tree models that are easier to interpret than a multiclass classification model.
