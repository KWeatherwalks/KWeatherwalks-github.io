## A Curious Phrase

There's a interesting phrase being thrown about in programming circles: learn in public. The idea is to share what you are learning to give yourself an extra nudge of accountability while also connecting with other learners.

Now, you may have heard of the [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) where a programmer commits at least one hour per day to learn a new coding skill or to work on a project, and then document this experience publicly via a social-media post. This idea felt familiar to me, but I couldn't quite figure out why until recently. Then, I remembered my old blog site that documented my progress through the first few years of college as a nontraditional student (interested in physics) pursuing a degree in mathematics. I titled the site [*Physicist By 40*](https://physicistby40.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-32-year-old-freshman-only-thing.html) because my long-term goal at the time was to get a PhD in physics before I turned 40. However, I fell in love with mathematics along the way so I decided to pursue a mathematics PhD sometime during my "junior" year.

But, if it isn't already obvious from my profiles, my current long-term goal is to become the best data scientist I can be. Why data science? Well, academia didn't seem as appealing as I initially thought after I spent one year in the graduate program at the University of Delaware. During that time I found out that‚Äîwhile solving abstract problems is a fun way to spend a few hours or a weekend‚Äîbuilding and delivering useful tools and insights is what drives the curiosity engine within me.

Which brings me to my short-term goal: Get hired. I want to start practicing my skills in a meaningful way, but I've had a difficult time finding that first job after graduating from Lambda School's Data Science program. That is why I've decided to revive the spirit of my old blog site by starting this one.

This is ...

### How I Will Learn in Public and Why

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s Quincy Larson has some wise words for aspiring developers, engineers, and data scientists:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üõ†Ô∏è Build your skills.<br><br>üëÇ Build your reputation.<br><br>üåê Build your network.<br><br>Your career success depends on all three of these.<br><br>Don&#39;t make the mistake of focusing on only one or two. Think about ways you can build all three at the same time.</p>&mdash; Quincy Larson (@ossia) <a href="https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1079942716480344065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In each of those areas of focus you can find learning-in-public(LiP) beneficial because:

1. LiP *shows* everyone that you are learning something new
1. LiP *shapes* how others perceive you
1. LiP *spreads* your name around, facilitating connections with others in the industry

## `git commit -am "weekly update"`

To ensure I focus equally on all three, I pledge to provide a weekly update about the things I am doing to achieve my goals (long-term and short-term). These updates will structured into the three sections: Building My Skills, Building My Reputation, Building My Network. The content in each section will probably change over time since I don't exactly have many ideas about what I can do to build my reputation, but building projects is a good first step.

If you want to follow along, see the links in the [Building My Network](#building-my-network) section.

### Building My Skills

#### Books

This week I'm reading:

- [*Doing Data Science*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17346997-doing-data-science) by [Rachel Schutt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelschutt/) and [Cathy O'Neil](https://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg)
- [*How Charts Lie*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43726576-how-charts-lie) by [Alberto Cairo](https://twitter.com/AlbertoCairo)
- [*Python Data Science Handbook*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26457146-python-data-science-handbook) by [Jake VanderPlas](https://twitter.com/jakevdp)

#### Courses

I'm working on my writing so I can be a better communicator in job interviews and outreach, and I'm refreshing my SQL skills to get past data-engineering related technical challenges.

- [Good with Words: Writing and Editing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-editing-words) on Coursera
- [Writing in the Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite) on Coursera
- [Complete SQL Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-sql-guide/) on Udemy

### Building My Reputation

#### Projects

My personal website has been a pet project for the past month and I have learned a lot about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) in the process. But, I am on the look-out for a new portfolio project where I can showcase my data analytics skills.

### Building My Network

#### Mentoring

Mentoring was one of my favorite experiences at Lambda School. I would like to mentor someone again, provided that they are a good fit for my current skills and knowledge base. Once I work out the details, I will share a form so aspiring data scientists can fill it out.

I'm looking for a mentor as well. If you, or someone you know, would like to help me as I enter the first stages of my data science career, please contact me ASAP.

#### Contact Me

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KWeatherwalks) for updates, and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-weatherwalks/). I welcome any feedback as I work towards building strong professional and personal relationships.
