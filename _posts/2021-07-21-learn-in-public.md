## A Curious Phrase

There is an exciting phrase being thrown about in programming circles: **learn in public**. The idea is to share what you are learning to hold yourself accountable while connecting with other learners.

Now you may have heard of the [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), where a programmer commits at least one hour per day to learn a new coding skill or to work on a project. They document this experience publicly via regular social media posts.

The idea felt familiar to me, but I couldn't quite figure out why until recently. Then I remembered my old blog site, [*Physicist By 40*](https://physicistby40.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-32-year-old-freshman-only-thing.html).
I chose the title based on my long-term goal at the time: get a Ph.D. in physics before I turned 40. The site documented my progress through the first few years of college as a nontraditional student (interested in physics) pursuing a degree in mathematics.
However, during my "junior" year, I fell in love with understanding problem-solving techniques that facilitate solutions by making the problems more abstract. So I pursued an advanced degree in mathematics instead.

> The best laid schemes o‚Äô mice an‚Äô men. Gang aft a-gley.

If it isn't already apparent from my profiles, my current long-term goal is to become the best data scientist I can be. Why data science? Well, academia didn't seem as appealing as I initially thought after one year in the graduate program at the University of Delaware. During that time, I discovered that I liked to build and deliver valuable tools and insights even more than I enjoyed solving abstract problems. Both activities rev my curiosity engine, but one allows me to quickly recognize my contributions to the world.

This brings me to my short-term goal: **get hired.** I want to start practicing my skills in a meaningful way, but I am struggling to land that first tech job after graduating from Lambda School's Data Science program. To help achieve this goal, I am summoning the spirit of my old blog site and starting this one.

### How I Will Learn in Public and Why

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s Quincy Larson has some wise words for aspiring developers, engineers, and data scientists:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üõ†Ô∏è Build your skills.<br><br>üëÇ Build your reputation.<br><br>üåê Build your network.<br><br>Your career success depends on all three of these.<br><br>Don&#39;t make the mistake of focusing on only one or two. Think about ways you can build all three at the same time.</p>&mdash; Quincy Larson (@ossia) <a href="https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1079942716480344065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In each of those areas of focus you can find learning-in-public(LiP) beneficial because:

1. LiP *shows* everyone that you are learning something new
1. LiP *shapes* how others perceive you
1. LiP *spreads* your name around, facilitating connections with others in the industry

## `git commit -am "weekly update"`

To ensure I focus equally on all three, I pledge to provide a weekly update about what I am doing to achieve my goals (long-term and short-term). These updates will have three sections: *Building My Skills*, *Building My Reputation*, and *Building My Network*. Each section's content will likely change over time since I have few ideas about what I can do to build my reputation. In any event, building projects is an excellent first step.

See the links in the *[Building My Network](#building-my-network)* section if you want to follow along.

### Building My Skills

#### Books

This week I'm reading:

- [*Doing Data Science*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17346997-doing-data-science) by [Rachel Schutt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelschutt/) and [Cathy O'Neil](https://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg)
- [*How Charts Lie*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43726576-how-charts-lie) by [Alberto Cairo](https://twitter.com/AlbertoCairo)
- [*Python Data Science Handbook*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26457146-python-data-science-handbook) by [Jake VanderPlas](https://twitter.com/jakevdp)

#### Courses

I'm working on my writing to be a better communicator in job interviews and outreach. At the same time, I'm refreshing my SQL skills to get past data-engineering-related technical challenges.

- [Good with Words: Writing and Editing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-editing-words) on Coursera
- [Writing in the Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite) on Coursera
- [Complete SQL Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-sql-guide/) on Udemy

### Building My Reputation

#### Projects

This website has been my pet project for the past month; I learned a lot about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) in the process. Still, I am looking to start a new portfolio project that can showcase my data analytics skills.

### Building My Network

#### Mentoring

Mentoring was one of my favorite experiences at Lambda School. I want to mentor someone again, provided that they fit my current skills and knowledge base. Once I work out the details, I will share a form so aspiring data scientists can fill it out.

I'm looking for a mentor as well. If you, or someone you know, would like to help me as I enter the first stages of my data science career, please contact me ASAP.

#### Contact Me

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KWeatherwalks) for updates, and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-weatherwalks/). I welcome any feedback as I work towards building strong professional and personal relationships.
