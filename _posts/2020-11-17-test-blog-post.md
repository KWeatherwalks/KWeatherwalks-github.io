# Foreword
A note about studying race.  
Race: the perceived differences in groups of people based on physical and genetic traits.  
In this sense, race *does not exist* as the differences within any group of people tend to be wider and more numerous than differences between groups. In her book *Superior*, Angela Saini covers the long history of such failed attempts to categorize people based on physical and genetic traits along with the horrors generated by them. I stand with Saini in saying that that type of research is unethical and should not be conducted.  
What I believe we should study in regard to race is the sociological effects of using these labels as identities and looking at how the systems we create and the policies we enact negatively impact people of different identities.

# Introduction

## Research Question
Broad: Is there racial inequity in student disciplinary approaches?  
Specific: In the 2018-2019 school year, did public high schools in the Christina School District discipline\*[out-of-school suspension] 9th graders with different racial identities in equal proportions?

### Method
A $\chi^2$ test for independence between the race category and whether a student was given an out-of-school suspension or not. This method assumes that the proportions in each group are commensurate with the number of total out-of-school suspensions and the number of enrolled students\*[check notes].

### Null and Alternate Hypotheses
To answer this question, we define the null hypothesis as there being no relation\*[check notes] between racial category and out-of-school suspensions with the alternate hypothesis being that there is such a relation.  
We set the significance at the standard $\alpha=0.05$ and correct for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni. With 3 comparisons we have an adjusted significance level, $\alpha^\prime$ for each test of about $0.0167$.

# Data Wrangling
## Socrata Open Data
The dataset we will be using is from the data.delaware.gov open data portal \[[1]\] which we will access via Socrata's API endpoints. Through this endpoint, the data comes to us in JSON format and by default is limited to 1000 rows. We can get all the 653,417 rows of the data by appending the url with `$limit=654000` \[[2]\]

# Conclusion
I need to be clear about the conclusions that can be drawn from conducting this analysis. The analysis presented here cannot explain *why* there are differences in disciplinary action due to racial identity. It can only illuminate the reality that such differences exist so that further inquiry may reveal the causal factors.
