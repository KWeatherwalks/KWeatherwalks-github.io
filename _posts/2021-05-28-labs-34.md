# Introduction
For the final unit of my Lambda School journey, I worked on a large team of 20+ developers and data scientists for the nonprofit Human Rights First (HRF) in a month-long experience called Labs. [HRF helps connect immigration attorneys with asylum seekers](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/asylum) and provides valuable resources for those attorneys. Accordingly, HRF would like a web-based application that gives attorneys access to information about an immigration judge's past decisions and any factors that appear to bias those decisions. Lambda School and HRF have partnered to allow students to build and improve this web application. 
Our Labs team inherited a codebase to build upon the progress made by the previous five cohorts.

As the product rapidly approaches a minimally viable product (MVP), HRF would like to start demoing this application to a select group of immigration attorneys, who would be given access via invite-only. After meeting with my teammates, we decided that the best way to get feedback from this group is to set up a framework for rapidly building and demoing visualizations right in the web application.

*The catch:* the data scientists work mainly in Python while the web application uses Javascript. As a data science student who has spent the last five months mainly exercising my research skills, Labs was my first taste of working on a cross-functional team, so it was easy for me to feel sequestered away from the development side. How can we, as data scientists, work together with web developers to ensure that we can seamlessly contribute to development?

# Planning
After a whole week of planning tasks and translating product-roadmap features to user stories, I worked closely with a fellow data scientist named Filipe and the back-end web developers to outline the flow of data. We soon recognized that a significant hurdle was in front of us. Our data science team could not access the database that stores the case information necessary to create visualizations directly.
This left us with a few options:
1. assist the web developers with creating the visualizations in the back-end, 
1. set up access to the database for data scientists, or
1. set up a data flow between the back-end API and the data science API.

The first option would likely suffer from a lack of consistency since there is essentially a new batch of data science students onboarded every month. So, the project may lose progress as the new students gain the necessary knowledge about the web team's tech stack. 
The second option is tempting, but our team couldn't see a reasonable solution that we could implement quickly enough to start exploring visualizations. 

Thus, we chose option three and set up a data flow where the back-end sends case information to an endpoint in the data science API as a POST request. Then, the data scientists manipulate that data to create charts using Plotly. Finally, the information to recreate the chart in Plotly is returned to the back-end as JSON formatted data. The web developers then send this data to the front-end to display the charts on the website. This was all made possible by web developer Daniel Gamboa's excellent work as architect of this flow and the web team.

# Implementation
With the plan in place, we began working on the details. We met with and received feedback from the associate data science leader. Following that meeting, I guided Filipe through building the endpoint in FastAPI to deliver a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of case outcomes, a basic visualization to get us started. We coordinated with the back-end team and found a problem with the data format we had for the endpoint. In our rush to set up a viable local test, we forgot to set our endpoint to receive POST requests. I hopped into a video call with the web team to remedy this, eager to start coding myself.   
I began by examining the documentation for FastAPI. We needed to use a class called `Request` from [FastAPI]() to receive the case data properly. A few code lines later, we were ready to test using [Postman](). Daniel shared a chunk of JSON with some case data to send a POST request to our endpoint. After our API responded with JSON data that can be passed into Plotly to recreate the chart, we smiled in celebration.


# Stakeholder feedback
Rolling with this progress

There are several


Special thanks, in no particular order, to Joseph Panetta, Filipe Collares, Rebecca Duke Wiesenberg, Daniel Gamboa, Paul St. Germain, Jacob Bohlen, Nick Allen, Jonathan Mary, and Sebastian Espeset for their diligent work on this project.

# Additional info I wanted to include but could not find a place for
- We want feedback from the stakeholder and users. We need a workflow for researching visualization ideas and seamlessly integrating them into the web application.
- We need to coordinate on the styling of the visualizations, and the web team has ownership over those choices.

# How you went about problem-solving?
- Met with Filipe and web team to set up work flow for the visualizations. 
- Week two, we explored individual data viz and set up deployment of DS API
- Week two,



We spent the first week planning 
After planning to jump
- Met with web team to discuss architecture for visualization flow.  
- Daniel created architecture diagrams that were clear and explained them very well.
- Worked with Plotly to set up the data flow. (link to Plotly docs)


After creating an [association matrix heatmap](), I presented the visualization to the stakeholders to get feedback. I asked them, 
- "is this type of chart useful as a whole?"
- "which parts of this visualization are useful?"
- "would it be better to have text information in place of visualization?"
A: Perhaps. If there is a summary saying something like "X feature shows a strong positive impact on the outcome"

A: How do the variables that I can control as a lawyer impact the outcome?
A: It might be more useful to see a multivariate approach.


What parts of this visualization are useful?  
Would text display this information better?  
Welton would like to see the direction of the "correlation" as well as the strength.
